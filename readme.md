# 🎯 QuizMate

## 📌 Overview
The **Quiz Platform** is a web-based application that allows quiz setters to create multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using text or voice input. Each quiz is secured with a unique code and password, ensuring controlled access for students. After completion, student scores are automatically sent to the quiz setter for evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Quiz Creation** – Set MCQs via text or voice input.  
✅ **Secure Access** – Each quiz has a unique code & password.  
✅ **Student Participation** – Students can join using the quiz code.  
✅ **Automated Scoring** – Final scores are sent to the quiz creator.
